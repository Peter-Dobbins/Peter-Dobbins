    <h2>Peter Dobbns Vs Harhill Ltd</h2>
      
      <p>Welcome to my website and welcome to my battle against the justice system which, I hope to prove to you, is woefully incompetent. <br><br> I lost the Tribunal and my Appeal was unsuccessful, the reasons for which, as stated by Judge B Clarke, can be found by following the “Response” link to the left of this page; it takes you to another section of this document. The Judgment is already online and can be found by searching, "P Dobbins Vs Harhill Ltd".</p> 
      
      <p>Every section headed "Appeal" quotes the Appeal I wrote against the Judgment. Sections sub-headed "Appeal Judge's Response" or "Judge's Response" quote the Appeal Judge's response to my Appeal. One of the rules of appealing states that one can not quote the Judgment, but I can do so here. I can also supply the evidence for you to make your own judgment as to whether I had been granted full access to Justice or not.

      </p>
      
      <p>The reasons I decided to do this is, one, a web development course required me to do a technical documentation website for a project, and two, I wanted to clear my name. The Tribunal Judgment will follow me around forever and there are spurious allegations in that Judgment that were recorded as fact. This cannot be fair. I know better than anybody that life is not fair. But I do like to level-up the playing field, and this website enables me to do that.

      </p>
      
      <p>For legal reasons, I had to argue my case as it relates to law, so rather than rewriting the arguments for the sake of this website, I have merely copied and pasted the Appeal with one minor difference: in the Appeal, I quote numbers and lines of the Judgment because I was prohibited from quoting that Judgment, whereas on this website I directly quote what the relevant section of the Judgment records. After each section, I have put what the Appeal Judge's response was, and after that I have put my response to that response.

     <p class="mid">A Quick Synopsis of the Case</p>
  
     <p>I was working at Queens Park Hotel, which operates as a homeless hostel, and uncovered drug dealers selling street Valium, which is a lethal drug. I asked a senior member of Night Shift about it and he told me staff had known for a long time, and that those I had uncovered were probably responsible for a death that occurred just before I began my employment.
       </p> 
     
       <p>I put this to a senior member of Day Shift (my shift), Ms Smith, and after some text messages, an argument, an alleged complaint and one actual complaint, I was moved to Chez Nous Guest House. There, I evicted one drug dealer without issue. I put it to you that the following messages are proof that Ms Smith was privy to drug dealers living and operating in the hotel, and that she was well aware that the aforementioned persons were responsible for deaths on site. Because I was trying to address this issue and thus expose Ms Smith's gross negligence, she had me moved.
       </p>

    <br>
    <p>I would help service users where I could as my comparator, H, would also do. On the morning in question at Chez Nous Guest House I helped a resident with a phone call, and was dismissed. This was becasue, quite frankly, Mr Logan, the manager of Chez Nous, hates service users and would openly express this opinion, to the point where the free meals that came in daily were pushing him into retirement. In an argument about the service user who I'd helped, Mr Logan said he would be seeking a transfer out of there, which I took to mean, "you're getting sacked", as Mr Logan has been in the same seat for 30 years, and so I hit the record button on my phone. He also said, “H does the same”. H is Scottish and I am English. It was perfectly logical to bring a case of discrimination due to nationality against my employer. I would like to note at this point that it was agreed by all that Mr Logan said H does the same. This should have been all I needed to prove, but the Respondent muddied the waters to throw the Judge off the scent; muddied waters that consisted of a web of lies and misrepresentations that the Judge did not have the acuity to see through. 

    </p>
   
    <p>NB. I am the Claimant and Harhill LTD is the Respondent.

      <p>The following is the Appeal I made against the Judgment.</p>

          <p>Point (a) of the overriding objective: ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing.</p>
          <p class="appeal">The Appeal

          </p>
          
          <p>On two of the three Preliminary Hearings (PHs), both Judges had not read the Claimant’s documents, and made rulings by interpreting the Claimant’s documents via quotations relating to said documents in the Respondent’s documents. These were also the last two PHs and thus the most important with regards to decisions relating to the Final Hearing. From this point on, the parties were not on an equal footing.

          </p>
          
          <p class="judge">Appeal Judge’s Response</p>
          
          <p><em>"The claimant contends that judges at two of the three preliminary hearings held in the matter had not properly read his documents. That criticism does not relate to the judgment under appeal and, in any case, does not identify a procedural irregularity capable of constituting an error of law. This discloses no reasonable grounds for appeal."</em>
          </p>
          
          <p class="me">My Response</p>
          
          <p>The Judge did not “not properly read his documents”. They had not read them <u><strong>at all</strong></u>, and made a very important decision, that being to allow Mr Mukul Biswas the ability to not state his case (the person who wrote the dismissal letter), which meant the only time I would be hearing his case would be on the day in Court, and thus would not have time to gather evidence to refute Mr Biswas’ claims. Had my documentation actually have been read, the Judges would have known this. But it seems from the reply to the Appeal that, a Judge reading the documentation from only one party is not a “procedural irregularity”.

          <p>Porter v Magill [2002] 2 AC 357 at paragraph 103 states:</p>
          
          <p><em>“. . . whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility of bias.”
          </em></p>
          
           <p>
            Out of around 20 pages of the Judgment, two paragraphs tenuously address the Claimant’s arguments. There are also numerous allegations made by the Respondent that the Judgment portrays as fact, which I believe may also be a case of defamation. To give reference to this I would cover pretty much the whole document. If I were permitted to quote the Judgment I could detail each and every point, but sadly I am not permitted to do so. However, allegations written as fact by a Judge have serious, potentially ruinous, consequences for the Claimant’s future job prospects.
          </p>
          
          <p class="judge">Judge’s Response</p>        
            
          <p><em>"First, the ET is said to have addressed the claimant’s arguments at the hearing only tenuously, and to have made findings of fact that are defamatory of him. It is also said that the ET misrepresented or fabricated certain facts. The claimant has given no supportive examples of this. In terms, he says this is because he seeks to comply with the EAT’s direction (presumably paragraph 3.7.5 of the EAT’s Practice Direction) that he should avoid quoting from the judgment. He says this would require him, in effect, to quote the entire judgment. However, it is the task of an ET to make findings in fact and, in many cases, that will inevitably lead to findings that are critical of one or both parties. There is no specificity to this ground of appeal. It discloses no reasonable grounds for appeal, including in respect of bias."</em>

          <p>
            As you can see, I did not state that the Judge addressed my arguments only tenuously “at the Hearing”, as the Response states. I quite clearly state “20 pages of the Judgment”. It also states that I gave no supportive examples of fabrication and misrepresentation, yet supportive examples come later in the document. Why did the Appeal Judge not have the acuity to address this? You can see them here: <a id="bring-back" href="#one">One,</a> <a href="#two">Two,</a> <strong>NB:</strong> There are links to bring you back here called "Back to Bias".

          <p class="appeal">The Appeal</p>
            
          <p>
            During the Hearing, the Judge closed the Claimant’s line of questioning down relating to Ms Smith accepting and putting calls through to residents’ rooms who she knew to be drug dealers. The Judge closed this down because he said he would not have the Claimant accuse Ms Smith of a crime. But this was something the Claimant witnessed and also formed the crux of this part of the case, whereby Ms Smith had very good reason to have the Claimant moved from the hotel that she was nominally a manager of because she would not want things such as this coming out. A bit of case law that relates to this is: 
          </p>
          
          <p>Clydesdale Bank Plc v John Workman & Ors [2016] EWCA Civ 73:</p>
          
          <p>
            <em>“The Judge was not entitled to find the defendants guilty of dishonesty”.</em>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In stating that the Claimant was accusing Ms Smith of a crime, the Judge was stating the Claimant was a liar. The Judge was also extremely aggressive at this point, demoralising the Claimant from the offset of the Hearing. 
          </p>
          
          <p class="judge">Judge’s Response</p>
            
          <p>
            <em>"Second, the Employment Judge is said to have closed down lines of questioning improperly. However, a judge is entitled to control questions asked of those giving evidence so that the hearing focuses on that which is relevant to the issues that must be determined. The ET noted in its judgment that much of the claimant’s questioning was “totally irrelevant”. In respect of the criticism that the Employment Judge would not permit the claimant, through his questions, to accuse a witness of a crime, it is appropriate for a judge to intervene because those giving evidence have a privilege against self-incrimination. This discloses no reasonable grounds for appeal, including in respect of bias."</em> 
          </p>
          
          <p class="me">My Response</p>
          
          <p>I would like to bring your attention to one part, which is as follows:</p>
          
          <p>
            <em>“However, a judge is entitled to control questions asked of those giving evidence so that the hearing focuses on that which is relevant to the issues that must be determined."</em>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The issues my questions surrounded were why I was moved from Queens Park Hotel. Was it because of a complaint, or was it because the nominal manager wanted me out because I was exposing her gross negligence that resulted in deaths on site? I put it to you that the Judge did not want to hear my defence.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Let me bring your attention to the following:
          </p>
         
          <p><em>“…it is appropriate for a judge to intervene because those giving evidence have a privilege against self-incrimination.”</em></p>
          
          <p>The Scottish Courts and Tribunal Service’s “Guide for Witnesses” (2019) states:</p>
          
          <p><em>A witness who objects to giving any evidence on the ground that it would tend to incriminate him or her is entitled to refuse to answer any question which he or she claims would have that effect. The objection must be raised by the witness and <b><u>the court cannot do it for them.</u></b>"</em></p>
          
          <p>
            So here we have it, quite clearly, that the Judge made an error in law and I put it to you that this is evidence of bias. How could two judges be unaware of the principles in law mentioned above?
         </p>
          
          <p class="appeal">The Appeal</p>
          
          <p>The Judge also on the behest of the Respondent’s counsel closed down a line of questioning regarding an email sent from the Claimant to Mr Biswas. The counsel said we did not have access to this email. The Claimant again and again said, “Please bear with me, this does have a logical conclusion”, yet the Judge forced him to show his hand, and at the mention of one name the room fell silent: ML [names redacted]. But the cat was out of the bag. 
         </p>
          
          <p class="me">Explanation</p>
          
          <p>
            The Claimant raised the issue of drug dealing with Ms Smith whilst at work, and they entered into an argument whereby Ms Smith said ML had made a complaint about the Claimant. The Claimant knew what Ms Smith was trying to do [she was trying to pin complaints onto me]. After this incident, when Ms Smith was off, Mr Biswas asked the Claimant to write a response to a complaint from ML, which was regarding Graham on nightshift. There was no Graham on night shift, it was WR, and the Claimant knew this because ML told him about it, describing WR. But the Claimant did not correct the fictitious name WR had given.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            At the Hearing, the Claimant picked this line of questioning up with Ms Smith, who again agreed ML had made a complaint about him, but could not be pushed on the matter because of a bad connection and then, as mentioned, her counsel closed the line of questioning down. I hoped to then raise this with Mr Biswas, and if successful, Ms Smith’s machinations of trying to stick complaints to the Claimant would all become clear. Yet that piece of legal gymnastics was closed down by the Judge and the chance lost. It was however completely omitted from the Judgment. Why would the Claimant press Ms Smith on <em>another</em> complaint had what he been saying a lie?
          </p>
          
          <p class="judge">Judge’s Reply</p>
          
          <p><em>"Third, the ET’s judgment is said to be silent on an exchange the claimant had with a witness about alleged drug dealing on the respondent’s premises. The ET does not need to make findings in respect of each and every piece of evidence that it heard, and it is entitled to limit its findings to those which are necessary to dispose of the issues that must be determined. This discloses no reasonable grounds for appeal, including in respect of bias."</em>
          </p>
          
          <p class="me">My Response</p>
          
          <p>I know, there were mental gymnastics that needed to be done to understand my point, but these are meant to be legally-trained professionals reading this. I would not mind if this was just one of my arguments missing from the Judgment, but ALL of my arguments are missing from the Judgment.

          </p>
          
          <p class="appeal">The Appeal</p>
          
          <p>Ms Smith was also clearly taking direction during the Hearing and the CVP connection was such that it rendered the CVP Hearing inept, yet the Judge failed to address this, even though a complaint was made by the Claimant.
          </p>
          
          <p class="judge">Judge’s Response</p>
          
          <p>There is no response to this point.</p>
          
          <p class="appeal">The Appeal</p>         <!-- THERES AS FACT, MINE AS OPINION -->
          
          <p>The Judge also omitted, misrepresented, altered and in some points completely fabricated many facts of the Hearing in his Judgment, of which I can discuss in detail but will not input them here as per the instructions: how can I include “full particulars” if I cannot include quotes from the Judgment? Again, I would be referencing pretty much every paragraph if I did so in the manner asked of me, and in some paragraphs there are numerous examples. There is also the element of the language he uses when describing the Claimant’s position against the Respondent’s position: the former written as opinion and the latter written as fact. Please remember the Judgment document will follow the Claimant around forever. [Please see <a id="go-back" href="#missed">here</a> for one relevant section. NB There is a link called "Go Back" to bring you back here.]

          </p>
          
          <p>The Judge also closed down a line of questioning because the Respondent’s counsel objected. It was regarding the Hate Crime Bill and the Claimant was putting to Mr Logan that, because of what was evident on the MP3 recordings (11.MP3 and 12.MP3), he had committed a crime under this bill. The objection was that it was a bill and not law and so no crime had been committed. It was upheld by the Judge and the line of questioning was aggressively closed down. This Bill was written into law in April 2021. The Judge illegally closed down this line of questioning because he did not know the law.  
          </p>

          <p class="judge">Judge’s Response</p>
          
          <p>
            There was no response to this, except for for what is mentioned earlier and, (I cannot be sure this was a response to the aforementioned):
          </p>
          
          <p><em>"The ET was only determining whether the claimant’s dismissal was an act of racial discrimination because of his English heritage. The ET, having noted that very little of the claimant’s case appeared to be directed towards demonstrating a discriminatory motive, decided there was no evidence that his English heritage had any influence whatsoever on the respondent’s decision."</em> 
          </p>
          
          <p class="me">My Response</p>
          
          <p>I accused Mr Logan of racial discrimination and offered evidence of Mr Logan committing this against somebody else, thereby bolstering my argument. This was closed down by the Judge, and as you can see, pretty much ignored by the Appeal Judge. Please note, the following examples – although only slight in one instance – were from only one day's work. I had to put up with incidents like this, especially incidents where Mr Logan would speak to residents in an imitation of their own accents, on a daily basis. I had also witnessed Mr Logan using the P-word on many occasions.</p>
          
          <p>Here is 11.MP3 and 12.MP3:</p>

          <p class="appeal">The Appeal</p>
          
          <p>The Judge also shouted at the Claimant when he cut off a witness he was questioning, telling him to let the witness finish. It is up to the Claimant whether or not the witness had answered the question, as it was the Claimant’s question the witness was answering and he was trying to stop the witness from rambling. This then forced the Claimant to let said witness (Mr Biswaz) ramble on and on with every proceeding question which tired the Claimant out. The Judge just let him ramble.
          </p>
          
          <p>The response from the Appeal Judge was that the Judge was entitled to do this, but my point is that the Judge should have also stopped him rambling. His failure to do so showed a complete bias.

          <p>Page 18 Point 58, the first sentence of the Judgment [this was an error on my part, it was point 59], reads:</p>
          
          <p><em>“There was a dispute between the claimant and Ms Smith and Mr Bizwas about whether Mr Smith <span class="sic">[sic]</span> had reported to Mr Bizwas that the claimant was going through residents’ belongings rather than simply going into their rooms and looking for evidence of drug dealing.” </em>
          </p>
          
          <p>The issue of drug-dealing on site was never fully addressed at the Hearing. The closest we came was something to do with drugs, drug taking or. . .? Ms Smith never actually got to the point the Claimant was pressing her on because the internet connection was so bad. And the Claimant's argument is completely ignored by the Judge here. The Claimant was building a case to evict drug dealers known to be responsible for <b> <u>drug deaths</u></b>. This is what is meant by Page 18 Point 58 [59]. And look at the two options the Judge offers: I was either going down residents' belongings looking to steal from them or snooping around looking for evidence of drug dealing. Neither were true. The evidence that alerted me to the drug dealers' activites was residents informing me of it. When I started to ask around I was told the suspects would become aggressive if people refused their product.

          <p><em>"Fifth, and more generally, the claimant criticises various points of the judgment where it is said that the judge “skilfully skirt[ed] the issue” or misunderstood the arguments. This appears to be an attempt to reargue the case that was before the ET. The ET was not dealing with a wider enquiry into the respondent’s operation or even whether the respondent had treated the claimant unreasonably; as it stated, it was not its task to determine whether the respondent ran its business correctly or incorrectly."</em>

          <p class="me">My Response</p>
         
          <p>I would like to bring your attention to:</p>
          
          <p><em>“…was not dealing with a wider enquiry into the respondent’s operation or even whether the respondent had treated the claimant unreasonably.”</em>
          </p>
          
          
          <p>Whether the Claimant had been treated unreasonably was <em>exactly</em> what this Tribunal was meant to be addressing. The whole issue of my time at Queens Park had to be addressed because of the accusations being made against me that bolstered the Respondent’s case, and this issue would also show that Mr Biswas was an unknowing puppet of Ms Smith and Mr Logan, thus bolstering my argument that, if Mr Logan ordered my dismissal, Mr Biswas would act on that. The aforementioned point is vital to understanding this case; Mr Biswas being a puppet of Ms Smith and Mr Logan, as it was Mr Biswas who wrote the dismissal letter, but Ms Smith who wanted me moved and Mr Logan who wanted me sacked. They used Mr Biswas like a puppet, but the Judge was unable to see this point. Remember, it was Mr Biswas who wrote the dismissal letter, and the Judge did not have the mental acuity to see it was not Mr Biswas who I was accusing of discrimination.

          <p>Page 5 Point 15 [of the Judgment], reads:</p>
          
          <p><em>“Ms Smith’s position was that there were certainly issues with the residents in the hotel taking illegal drugs. She had a very good relationship with a community police officer and would discuss matters with the police. The police had been involved in the death which had occurred on the premises which had been investigated. She considered it to be totally inappropriate for the claimant to take on the job of the police and social work when his job was a hotel porter.”</em>
          </p>
          
          <p class="appeal">The Appeal</p>
          
          <p>This paragraph wilfully ignores the fact that it was not the taking of drugs that was the issue here, but the selling of drugs. The Judge skilfully skirts the issue which again serves the purpose of framing Ms Smith as innocent and in the right. It was also the Claimant’s job to evict people; the police or social workers cannot do this. And Ms Smith never told the police about staff suspicions. This element was not investigated fully. Do you not think the police would have at least interviewed those who senior staff members suspected were responsible had they been informed of CCTV footage and numerous allegations? And the Claimant’s position is nowhere to be seen.

          <p><em>“Mr Logan also became concerned that the claimant <b>began to exhibit</b> the same behaviours as he had at Queens Park in that he sought to investigate various residents who he <b>considered</b> were dealing drugs.

          <p id="missed">The Claimant’s position written as opinion and Mr Logan’s position written as fact. The Claimant’s argument to this allegation is supported by evidence, namely Mr Logan’s statement and testimony, and yet the Claimant’s argument is nowhere to be seen. </p>

          <p class="me">My Response</p>
          
          <p>My argument was that I was not listening at the door of the resident; it was at the door of reception. Just by that door is a set of stairs where two residents were having a conversation about what drugs one of them had for sale. I then told Mr Logan about it and that I wanted to evict the drug dealer. He told me I had to speak to the owner, Mr Ikram Mohammad Hussain. I did so, and then evicted the drug dealer. I can support this with the records I have on file. But why should evicting drug dealers be so difficult? Why is it that, someone asking for tea and coffee a little too regularly will soon find themselves evicted and someone causing drug deaths not? The reason I had to address this during the Hearing was these were serious allegations being levelled against me.

          </p>

          <p id="back2">Here is Mr Logan's Personal Statement given before the date of the Hearing. At the Hearing, I brought up the aforementioned argument and Mr Logan remembered and agreed that it was the truth. I would like to bring your attention to the fact that he discusses the actual reason for dismissal, which was helping a service user with a phone call. I did not let the service user use the office phone, as Mr Logan stated; I put the call through to the service user's room. So now the only question left is the cost of the call, and please bear in mind the issues I mention <a href="#back1">here</a>, which relate to allegations I made against the owner instructing his staff to commit fraud. And let us not forget that, if my £16/month contract gives me free calls, I feel sure a business is in receipt of a similar deal. (NB: There is a link that says "Back to Mr Logan's Statement" to bring you back here). Secondly is that Mr Logan mentions taking an interest in residents, and directly relates this to evicting one of them. Yes, I did become interested in residents, when I realised they were a danger to other service users, and yes, I would happily evict them.</p>

          <p>14. Yeboah v Crofton [2002] IRLR 634 at paragraph 93, Mummery LJ said:</p>
          
          <p><em>Such an appeal ought only to succeed where an overwhelming case is made out that the Employment Tribunal reached a decision that no reasonable tribunal, on a proper application of the evidence and the law, would have reached. Even in cases where the appeal tribunal has grave doubts about the decision of the employment tribunal, it must proceed with great care</em> 
          </p>
          
          <p class="appeal">The Appeal</p>
          
          <p>The following are rulings that the Claimant believes no reasonable tribunal would have reached:</p>
          
          <p>A) The Judge’s belief that a laptop makes no noise when it’s being typed on.</p>
          
          <p>The Claimant gave MP3 evidence of him typing up his novel, attempting to show it did not affect his work and was never an issue for Mr Logan and the Claimant was certainly never asked to stop doing it. The Judge said the noise was not the Claimant’s laptop as the Claimant’s laptop made no noise. Page 13 Point 43 reads:

          </p>
          
          <p><em>“On one of the recordings, there is the sound of typing. The claimant sought to show that this was evidence that his typing was not something Mr Logan had a problem with. The Tribunal’s view on the balance of probabilities was that the sounds were of the claimant inputting data into the respondent’s computer which made a noise rather than his own laptop which did not make a noise.”</em>
          </p>
          
          <p class="judge">Judge's Response</p>
          
          <p><em>"The third ground of appeal is one of perversity, namely that the ET came to a decision to which no reasonable tribunal could come, or which was contrary to the evidence it heard. This is a high hurdle; see Yeboah v Crofton as quoted by the claimant. There is no reasonable prospect of demonstrating that this judgment was perverse. <span id="what?">The judgment is clear and well-structured,</span> and the ET’s conclusions were entirely open to it on the facts as it found them to be."</em> 
          </p>

          <p id="above">The above response is the only one for this entire section.</p>

          <p>You can ignore the links below at the moment. Each point is bringing your attention to the phrase "The judgment is clear and well-structured".</p>

          <p>I have not included the MP3 because it recorded the personal details of those not involved in this case, and to alter the sound frequency of the MP3 would alter the sole purpose of it.

          <p>B) On 5.mp3, Mr Logan and the Claimant are watching TV. The Claimant tells a resident, “It’s OK, we’re only watching TV”. This was used to show there were many hours where there was no work to do, and so the allegation of the Claimant typing up his book being a problem was a complete fabrication. (Page 13 Point 43). The Judge completely dismissed this [and failed to address its relevance]. He did not even understand the relevance, evidenced by his comment.

          <p>This is all that is recorded in the Judgment. The Appeal Judge did not even address it. Here is 5.MP3.</p>

          <p>C) The Judge never addressed (and so made a tacit ruling of) the element raised during Mr Logan’s testimony, when the Claimant asked “how did this conversation go?” (with regards to Mr Logan asking the Claimant to stop writing his book). Was it, “Please stop typing that book, Mr Dobbins.” “No, I won’t.” 

          </p>
          
          <p>Mr Logan’s reply to this line of questioning was good evidence to suggest that this type of conversation never occurred, yet the whole premise was not only not addressed by the Judge in his Judgment, it was completely ignored. This was fundamental to this element of the case. No rational person would ignore a fundamental aspect in their Judgment. 

          </p>
          
          <p class="me">My Response</p>
          
          <p>Mr Logans reply to that line of questioning was that I closed my laptop, and then opened it again and carried on typing. When he said it at the Hearing, it came across as logical as you just read it. 

          </p>
         
          <p class="appeal">The Appeal</p>
          
          <p>D) [Another element that proves Perversity] The Judge’s readiness to accept Ms Smith’s words which conflicted with two major pieces of evidence. Page 5 Point 16, [reads:

          </p>
          
          <p id="concerned"><em>“Ms Smith also became concerned that during his time at Queens Park, the claimant advised her that he was writing a novel and would spend considerable amounts of time when he <span class="sic">[sic]</span> at work apparently writing or revising the novel on his laptop. The claimant’s role involved him working 12 hour shifts and for much of these shifts, not much was happening. Ms Smith was not particularly bothered about him writing his novel but did report this to Mr Bizwas.”]</em>
          </p>
          
        
          
          <p id="back3">This paragraph conflicts with <em>itself</em>. [Let me remind you of <a href="#what?">this!</a> NB: There's a link called "Back to Ms Smith's Statement" to bring you back here]. Ms Smith’s statement mentions nothing about writing a book. The Claimant asked her about this at the Hearing. She said it was never a problem. When the Respondent’s representative asked her if she told Mr Biswas about the Claimant writing his book, she said yes. The aforementioned sections grossly misrepresent the facts, and the representative used leading question techniques to achieve his goal. You must remember Ms Smith is a current employee of the Respondent and was Ordered to attend as a witness on the behest of the Claimant. The Judge swallowed it whole. 
          </p>
          
          <p class="me">My Response</p>
          
          <p>Ms Smith’s statement can be found below. Notice that she writes, "I made it known to my boss", rather than, "becasue of a complaint". Their story is all over the place, so much so that it does make it difficult to untangle the web and present it, but nowhere is there a mention of writing a book. And to <a href="#concerned">this</a> point earlier: At the beginning she is "concerned", and at the end she is "not particularly bothered". Need I remind you of <a href="#what?">this</a>? NB: There is a link called "Back to Ms Smith's Statement" that will bring you back here."

          <p>E) Page 5 Point 12 [states:</p>
         
          <p><em>“He indicated that it was his intention to advise thim <span class="sic">[sic]</span> of his suspicions and give them details on <span class="sic">[sic]</span> the dates on which people had put information in the diary and tell them that if they stepped out of line, again, they would be evicted. He said that he would threaten that he would go to the police and have the bags he had taken from their rooms fingerprinted and examined for drug residue.</em>
          </p>

          
          <p id="one">The Judge blithely accept[ed] that the Claimant entered residents’ rooms and took things from them. The Claimant is indirectly quoted here. This quote is either misrepresented or fabricated; you can be the judge of that. The way in which the Claimant became aware of drug packets was when the cleaners would empty out an eviction and bring them to him. He was also requested by Mr Logan and Ms Smith to enter rooms when doing the Death Check (a daily check to ensure nobody is lying dead for days which came about because a body at the Alexander Thomson was only found because of the smell). This argument is missing in the Judgment, and no rational person would ignore that in their Judgment.

          <p>F) The allegation of leaving the reception. </p>
          
          <p>Page 10 Point 34 [reads:</p>
          
          <p><em>“At some point around the end of April 2021, Mr Hussain and Mr Bizwas had a conversation between themselves and the other manager, Mr Adam Hussain, about the claimant. All were aware of the issues which had occurred at Queens Park. They also believed that on the basis of what Mr Logan was telling them, there were regular issues with the claimant at Chez Nous in respect of leaving reception, writing his novel while he was at reception, listening at guests’ bedrooms and also going into guests’ bedrooms and taking too much of an interest in their affairs. They felt that this conduct was unacceptable and decided that they would dismiss the claimant."</em>
          </p>
      
          <p>Here we have clear evidence the Respondent was attempting to pile on anything they could because they did not have an argument. Please see the job description at Page 3 Point 8, the first bullet point [other important bullet points are also omitted from this Job Description]. No sane person would confirm this as a legitimate reason for dismissal considering the aforementioned bullet point. </p>
          
          <p class="me" id="back4">My Response</p>
          
          <p>Page 3 point 8 [mentioned above] reads:</p>
          
          <p><em>“The job description for the claimant’s job as a porter was lodged (pages 123- 126).</em></p>
          
          <p><em>The principle duties were:</em></p>
          
          <p><em> • to maintain a visible presence <b><u>in and around the hotel</u></b>. . . ” </em></p>
         
          <p>So I was dismissed in part for something that is on the job description? Remember <em>"there were regular issues with the claimant at Chez Nous in respect of leaving reception".</em></p>
          
          <p>Also, there were never any accusations regarding going into guests rooms at Chez Nous. This point seems to have gone over the Judge’s head, much the same as everything else. Remember <a href="#what?">this?</a> <b>NB</b>: There is a link called "Back to Job Description" to bring you back here.

          <p>G)  Mr Logan imitating a Chinese accent not being regarded as racist [proving perversity]. The Judge said Mr Logan apologised and that he agreed with Mr Logan that imitating a Chinese accent was not racist. Yet, a racist person does not get to decide what is or is not racist, as per the Hate Crime Bill. It is the person listening, not the person speaking, who decides. Again, the Judge shows his ignorance of the law. Page 16 Point 53 [reads:
            
          </p>
          
          <p><em>“This was a case where the claimant asked the Tribunal to draw a number of inferences from the evidence which the Tribunal did not consider justified. The claimant’s position was that the <span class="sic">[sic]</span> believed that Mr Logan was a racist. He believed that this was established from the fact that Mr Logan could be heard on one of the tapes imitating a Chinese accent and on one of the other recordings is not heard to intervene or object when another member of staff uses the “P word” in his presence.The Tribunal accepted that Mr Logan had imitated a Chinese type accent however accepted his explanation that whilst it was a mistake on his part and he regretted doing this, this did not mean he was a racist.”]</em>
          </p>
          
          
          <p>H)  The Judge agreed that the word “Paki” had not been heard by Mr Logan because Mr Logan was ready to go home, even though Mr Logan responded to the sentence in which this word was used. The fact that this word was used in a sentence addressed to Mr Logan is also omitted from the Judgment. Page 16 Point 53. And what is this leap of logic? This too is omitted from the Judgment. Let us add up what we know: A subordinate used the word “Paki” in a question directed to his superior. The superior replied with a lucid answer to that question. The subordinate had either been living under a rock since the 60s, or felt comfortable using this word with his superior, because his superior himself uses this word. The main evidence that was completely ignored is the Claimant’s testimony that he himself regularly had to listen to his superior using this word. How much more evidence would this judge need?

          </p>
          
          <p class="me">My Response</p>
          
          <p>Page 16 point 53 of the Judgment reads:</p>
          
          <p><em>“We accepted his evidence that he had not heard the P word and note that the claimant was also present and did not intervene or object. We also did not accept the claimant’s contention that the fact that the member of staff concerned used the P word in Mr Logan’s presence demonstrated that Mr Logan used the P word himself. This is a leap of logic which we were not prepared to make. We did accept Mr Logan’s evidence that he has been involved in a hotel housing the homeless for around 34 years and over this time has assisted people of many nationalities, races and religions. We accepted the evidence he gave that he was one of the first in Glasgow to welcome refugees and asylum seekers. We should say that on the evidence we heard, there is absolutely no justification for labelling Mr Logan a racist.”</em> 
          </p>

          <p>I) Page 16 Point 54. The Judge in his Judgment said Mr Logan was polite on the MP3 recordings. Mr Logan called a resident a “beggar” who was “worse than Oliver” on 6.MP3. This is omitted from his Judgment. No Judge in his right mind would have come to that conclusion given the evidence. 

          </p>
          
          <p>Page 16 Point 54 reads:</p>

          <p id="two">J) Page 6 Point 19 (directly quoted below). This version of events is a complete fabrication and done so in a way to ensure the Claimant’s conduct is brought into question. I believe it is unlawful to defame the Claimant in such a way. However, the fact that Mr Biswas ordered to evict anybody who was loud outside was not taken into consideration with the overall complaint: it was because of this order why the Claimant and resident began to argue. This then overspilled into another argument, Page 7 Point 20 [another misrepresentation (which is directly quoted below)]. Yet the Judgment omits that it was due to government COVID-19 guidelines that the Claimant was opening all the entrances to the hotel to create a breeze as per the instructions. Ms Smith seized this opportunity, the same way she tried to seize the opportunity with ML’s complaint [mentioned earlier, where the complaint was about Night Shift], and used this as a means to have the Claimant moved. Had she been on shift when ML’s complaint came in, she would have seized that one too. But the Judge completely ignores this. Remember what was being dealt with between the Claimant and Ms Smith: People dying because of drug dealers that Ms Smith was well aware of. This is proven in the WhatsApp messages. Yet this issue is written as the Claimant’s opinion.

Mr Bizwas was concerned about this incident combined with the other complaints made by Ms Smith about the claimant taking an undue interest in residents’ affairs and going into their rooms. He was aware that the claimant had been a good employee during the previous occasions he had worked for the company and decided that rather than dismiss him, he would try to keep his services and transfer him. Mr Bizwas visited the Queens Park Hotel and spoke to Ms L .<span>[During the height of the pandemic?].</span> She advised him verbally of her concerns about the incident. He did not obtain any written statement from her at that time.

            Ms L subsequently produced a statement setting out her version of events which was lodged (pages 134-135). In addition to complaining about the incident, she described the claimant’s behaviour as rude and abusive. She also complained about another occasion where the claimant had insisted on opening doors and windows in the hotel to ventilate it and when she complained had stated that he was entitled to a ventilated workplace. In her statement, Ms Smith expressed the view that the claimant was unsuited for his role. Mr Bizwas decided that he would move the claimant to one of the respondent’s other hotels in order to deal with the matter.</em>

          <p><em><u>What actually happened</u></em></p>
          
          <p>I was behind the reception dealing with a mentally-ill resident who was much larger than myself and who had recently been released from a 14-year prison sentence for the attempted murder of multiple police officers. L could not pass and so was standing on the stairs outside, as she could not come within 2m of the resident, and told him to "Move out of the way you ginger cunt". I then argued with L, telling her that I was instructed to evict anybody who was loud outside – and let's not forget the risk to life she nearly caused. When you marry the Judgment up to what L said, you can see the Judge got it wrong. When you marry that up to what I said, you can see that the Judge quoting Ms Smith and Ms L's statements as fact is in of itself, perverse. The following section proves I was instructed to evict people who were loud outside; and do not foget this woman called a dangerous criminal a "ginger cunt". Who is going to have to stop that man when he turns violent?

          <p>I believe the second argument with the service user occurred because of the first; we had never had a cross word prior to this. Ms Smith kept all windows and doors closed not because of COVID, but because she did not like what she called the “little beasties”: bugs, even butterflies. This was at the height of the summer. When I was the most senior member of staff on site I had everything open, and L came to the reception to tell me that if I did not keep everybody 2m apart, she will “kick-off”. (The doors being closed meant that it was easier to control the flow of people through reception, although people rarely listened to our order not to walk through when someone was at reception). I printed out numerous copies of the government COVID-19 guidelines and put them up around the hotel. When I came back from my four days off, I was told I wasn’t working there anymore. I called Mr Biswas to see what was happening and he said I should go to Chez Nous.

          <p>K) Mr Logan alleged an employee (H) would allow service users to use his personal mobile phone during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. You must remember that most service users are unkempt heroin addicts. The Judge accepted Mr Logan’s assertion without question, even though the Judge also agreed Mr Logan said “[H] does the same” [the same practice as the Claimant] Page 17 Point 55. This is also referred to at Page 12 Point 39. The Claimant’s testimony is completely ignored.

          <p>The Judge agreed that with me on the fundamental element of this case and yet does not seem to have the acuity to see that this was the foundation on which my claim was built upon. Once this element is agreed, I then only ned to address who really made the decision to dismiss me. We have evidence to suggest that it was Ms Smith who had me moved from Queens Park. Now all we need is some evidence to suggest that the decision was made on the day in question, and not before.

          <p class="appeal">The Appeal</p>
          
          <p>L)  The issue of why the Claimant had recorded a full day’s work was never addressed or equated in the probability of reason. The Claimant did so because Mr Logan said he would be “asking for a transfer out of there”, which the Claimant correctly took to mean he was getting sacked. The next day, he was sacked, yet the Respondent claims it was nothing to do with the aforementioned issue. The Claimant asserted that the mere existence of the MP3 recording, his reason for making the recording, [the Facebook messages] and the subsequent outcome all shifted the weight of probabilities in his favour, yet the Judge did not even acknowledge it in his Judgment, [and thus came to his conclusion without these elements adding their weight to the probability of reason, which no reasonable-minded person would do]. 
         </p>
        
        <p>M)  There are Facebook messages corroborating that the decision to dismiss was made on that day – the times of which are important (19:45). We finished work at (19:00). Mr Logan admitted in his evidence that he told the Claimant he would be “asking for a transfer out of there”, yet these supporting factors are not only not addressed, but completely ignored in the Judgment. [No reasonable-minded person would do so].
        </p>
          
        <p>N)  The Judge accepting the Respondent’s claim that the decision to dismiss was made 10-12 days prior to the dismissal letter (a point that was altered to 8 days in the Judgment). Yet we have Facebook messages at 19:45 discussing someone getting dismissed that evening and a letter of dismissal during office hours the next day. Why would Mr Biswas send a message to the man who needs to write the rota at 19:45 (around dinner time) on one evening, and then send a letter of dismissal during office hours the next day if the decision was made 10-12 or even 8 days prior? The weight of probabilities suggests all of this would have been done during office hours had the Respondent been telling the truth. Not unless the decision was made at around 19:45 on the day in question. The Respondent’s assertion just does not add up with the facts:
          </p> 
          
          <ol>
          <li>The existence of MP3 recordings</li> 
          <li>The Claimant’s reason for the recordings</li> 
          <li>Mr Logan’s admittance corroborating the reason for those recordings</li> 
          <li>The content of the recordings</li> 
          <li>The time and the existence of the Facebook messages</li> 
          <li>The time and existence of the dismissal letter</li> 
          <li>The dismissal being the following day of the recordings</li>
          <li>[The Respondent's assertion that they decided to dismiss the Claimant 10-12 days before the actual dismissal date]</li>
          </ol> 

          <p>This web of connecting evidence and the fact that it heavily weighed on the weight of probabilities was completely ignored by the Judge. And it was <u><b>crucial</b></u>.

          <p>The Gulf Agencies v Ahmed [2016] EWCA Civ 44 the Court of Appeal found the judge’s final position:</p>
          
          <p><em>". . . less than clear”</em>.</p>
          
          <p>Page 18 Point 60 of the Judgment discusses Mr Biswas not being asked certain questions by the Claimant. Page 22 Point 67 discusses a leap of logic that the Tribunal was asked to perform by the Claimant.

          </p>
          
          <p>Page 18 point 60 reads:</p>
          
          <p><em>"In general terms, very little of the claimant’s case or his cross examination appeared to be directed at demonstrating that there was any discriminatory motive whatsoever for his dismissal. Mr Bizwas was not asked if he even knew the claimant’s nationality far less was it put to him that he had a prejudice against English people. The high point of the claim appeared to be that the claimant was dismissed whilst H who was not English was not dismissed.”</em>
          </p>
          
          <p>Page 22 point 67 reads: </p>
          
          <p><em>“Furthermore, it is a massive leap of logic to go from a manager complaining about an employee doing something which the manager disapproves of and saying “and X does the same” to a finding that an entirely separate decision maker was guilty of unlawful discrimination.”</em>
          </p>
          
          <p>These two sections prove the Judge had not a single clue what this case was about. Never at any point had the Claimant asserted that what the Judge calls the “decision makers” were responsible for discrimination, nor had the Claimant asserted that Mr Biswas was guilty of discrimination. The Claimant asserted that Mr Logan was guilty of discrimination and had used Mr Biswas like a puppet to enact that discrimination. This is clearly documented ad infinitum in the literature. The Claimant tried to show this issue of Mr Biswas being a puppet at the Hearing by calling Ms Smith as a witness; she had done the same thing. She however did it because the Claimant was on course to uncovering and exposing gross misconduct on her part. Mr Logan used Mr Biswas like a puppet because he would not afford an Englishman the same leeway that he afforded his countryman who partook in the exact same practices that the actual dispute was centred on: the same dispute that led the Claimant to record 9 hours of his working day. The same dispute that resulted in the Claimant’s dismissal.

          </p>
          
          <p>Page 18 point 60, when read next to Page 22 Point 67, and Page 17 Point 55 of the Judgment, prove the Judge was not able to understand the gravity of Mr Logan’s words, [H] does the same, and was not able to comprehend the most fundamental aspect of this case: he was not able to understand who was being accused of what, and thus his ruling must be rendered void.

          <p>I have no words to describe the inanity of the sentence, “The high point of the claim appeared to be that the claimant was dismissed whilst H who was not English was not dismissed.” To bring a case of discrimination you need a comparator: someone who did the same but was not dismissed. Yes, it was the “high point”, really, it was the <em><b>only</b></em> point that had to be proven.

          <p><em>“The fourth ground of appeal is that the ET’s judgment was based on a point that was not argued. That ground also has no reasonable prospects. The ET dealt with the question of whether Mr Logan influenced the decision to dismiss at paragraphs 56-58. Its conclusions were open to it.”</em>       
          </p>
          
          <p>Paragraphs 56-58:</p>
          
          <p>There was a fundamental dispute between the parties as to the timing of the decision to dismiss and, as one would expect, the reason for dismissal. The claimant’s position was that something must have happened on 5 May which led to the decision to dismiss. He postulated that Mr Logan must have carried out his threat to tell the respondent’s management that he was wanting a transfer because he did not want to work any longer with the claimant, that this had led to his dismissal. The claimant’s sole evidence for this was the group messages starting at around 7pm on 5 May which indicated that the person who helped Mr Bizwas with the rota was only told about the need to make changes to the rota at around that time. The Tribunal did not accept this. The Tribunal accepted Mr Logan’s evidence that he had not in fact mentioned the dispute on the morning of 5 May to any of the respondent’s management on 5 May nor had he at anytime indicated that he was putting in for a transfer to the managers although he did accept that he had said this to the claimant. We accepted Mr Logan’s evidence that the first time he discussed the incident on 5 May was when he spoke to Mr Hussain the following day after the claimant had been dismissed. We accepted the evidence of Mr Logan and indeed Leslie Smith that both of them had made numerous complaints to the respondent’s managers about the claimant taking too close a personal interest in resident’s affairs. It was clear that both of them felt that he was behaving inappropriately towards residents. The Tribunal accepted the evidence of Mr Bizwas which was to the effect that he was concerned about the initial reports from Leslie Smith and in particular was concerned by the complaint which was made by resident L. We accepted his evidence that he met with resident L albeit this was disputed by the claimant who did not really have any basis on which to dispute this. There was a dispute between the claimant and Mr Bizwas in relation to how the claimant had been advised of his move to Chez Nous. The claimant’s position appeared to be that he had not known about the move until he turned up at Queens Park and was told that he working at Chez Nous. We preferred Mr Bizwas’ version which was that there had been a conversation. We also accepted Mr Bizwas’ evidence that he had told the claimant of his concerns and made it clear to the claimant that he was giving him a further chance.

          <p class="me">My Response</p>
          
          <p>The paragraphs above read like a logical stream of consciousness, even if I argue the points are illogical, the Judge addresses whether or not Mr Logan communicated with Mr Biswas or Mr Hussain with regards to the issue. The point I was making in the Appeal was that to even mention points that were not argued shows that the Judge did not have a full grasp of this case; he accused me of making a leap of logic I did not make, weakening my overall argument. Because he makes judgments in his Judgment about points that were not argued, it would seem reasonable to presume those points bore weight on the outcome, thereby showing evidence to suggest that the Judge reached his judgment on points that were not argued. But lets us stand back a moment: The Judge spent more time addressing arguments that were not argued than he did addressing my arguments.

          </p>
          
          <p>In the interest of transparency, I would like to add the rest of Page 22 Point 67 that I omitted earlier to keep everything on point. It reads:

          </p>
          
          <p><em>“In any event, it was absolutely clear from the evidence that H did not do the same as the claimant. There was no evidence to suggest that H did any of the things which the respondents based their decision to dismiss on; namely take an inappropriate interest in residents’ comings and goings, listening at doors, entering their rooms and seeking to gather evidence that they were drug dealers. For this reason, the claimant’s claim must fail.”</em>
          </p>
          
          <p class="me">My Response</p>
          
          <p>The allegation of taking an inappropriate interest in residents’ comings and goings was only ever loosely defined as wanting to evict drug dealers. You do also see other evidence of this allegation in the WhatsApp messages, where I am concerned for the safety of a resident. I think it could be agreed that, by the Judge failing to define what this term refers to, he leaves a loose end that could be easily construed as something lewd. The allegations of listening at residents' doors and entering rooms in an attempt to gather evidence are written here as fact without my arguments being addressed. This is not fair. The Judge could have at least explained why he dismissed my arguments, especially considering he would have been privy to the fact that that document will follow me around for the rest of my life.

          <p>It is quite clear from the arguments above that the Judge failed to grasp this case. It can also be proven, point by point, that the Judge omitted, misrepresented, altered and in some points completely fabricated many facts of the Hearing in his Judgment. I would love to be afforded the opportunity to deal with each of these by quoting the Judgment, but with the regulations imposed upon me in this document, it would be needlessly long. But serious instances are missing from this document because of the aforementioned regulations. And let us not forget that two Judges did not bother to read the Claimant’s documents in PHs. How is this fair?

          </p>
          
          <p>Now, because of this Judge and this process, a document of lies will be forever connected to the Claimant. </p>
          
          <p>Now, because of this Judge, the Claimant has been robbed of his access to justice.</p>
          
          <p>At the very least, this disgraceful Judgment can be edited to include the Claimant’s arguments, especially as we now live in an age where accusations are in of themselves judge, jury and executioner. Or what would certainly level the playing field, is if this document was to be published and attached to the Judgment.

I didn’t take the money because I wanted to out their crimes to the world and I felt that by taking the money I would have been turning my back on the people of Glasgow for a profit. The local media was not bothered about the fact that drug dealers were and are operating with impunity and causing deaths in hostels paid for by the taxpayer. I thought this would have been a big story when Scotland’s record of drug deaths is taken into consideration. Nobody was bothered.

          <p>Maybe it was the speaker they could not rely on. Maybe, had I been middle-class and had a traditionally-educated background, the world would have learned of Harhill Ltd’s crimes.

          <p id="back1">I also went to the police with allegations of Harhill Ltd's extortion from Glasgow City Council. The allegations were that Ikram Mohammad Hussain, referred to in the Judgment incorrectly as Ikbal, was forcing his employees to forge documents sent to the Council regarding who did/didn’t stay at the hotel, and thus extorting what I believe to be hundreds of thousands of pounds from Glasgow City Council over the course of decades (I provided documentation that I allege proves £15,000 worth of fraud over the course of 6 months from one hotel. Mr Hussain owns five). The last I heard was that the police were investigating. That was over a year ago. I also reported the racist recordings. I never heard anything about that.

          <p>I also told Glasgow City Council directly: they did nothing.</p>
          
          <p>They still send me threatening letters of court action if I miss my Council Tax bill by a month.</p>
